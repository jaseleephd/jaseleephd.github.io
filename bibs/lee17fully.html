        abstract = {Most existing machine translation systems operate at the
        level of words, relying on explicit segmentation to extract tokens. We
        introduce a neural machine translation (NMT) model that maps a source
        character sequence to a target character sequence without any segmentation.
        We employ a character-level convolutional network with max-pooling at the
        encoder to reduce the length of source representation, allowing the model to
        be trained at a speed comparable to subword-level models while capturing
        local regularities. Our character-to-character model outperforms a recently
        proposed baseline with a subword-level encoder on WMT'15 DE-EN and CS-EN,
        and gives comparable performance on FI-EN and RU-EN. We then demonstrate
        that it is possible to share a single character-level encoder across
        multiple languages by training a model on a many-to-one translation task. In
        this multilingual setting, the character-level encoder significantly
        outperforms the subword-level encoder on all the language pairs. We observe
        that on CS-EN, FI-EN and RU-EN, the quality of the multilingual
        character-level translation even surpasses the models specifically trained
        on that language pair alone, both in terms of BLEU score and human
        judgment.},
