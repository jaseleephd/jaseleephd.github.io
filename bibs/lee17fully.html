&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;abstract = {Most existing machine translation systems operate at the<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;level of words, relying on explicit segmentation to extract tokens. We<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;introduce a neural machine translation (NMT) model that maps a source<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;character sequence to a target character sequence without any segmentation.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;We employ a character-level convolutional network with max-pooling at the<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;encoder to reduce the length of source representation, allowing the model to<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;be trained at a speed comparable to subword-level models while capturing<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;local regularities. Our character-to-character model outperforms a recently<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;proposed baseline with a subword-level encoder on WMT'15 DE-EN and CS-EN,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;and gives comparable performance on FI-EN and RU-EN. We then demonstrate<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;that it is possible to share a single character-level encoder across<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;multiple languages by training a model on a many-to-one translation task. In<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;this multilingual setting, the character-level encoder significantly<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;outperforms the subword-level encoder on all the language pairs. We observe<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;that on CS-EN, FI-EN and RU-EN, the quality of the multilingual<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;character-level translation even surpasses the models specifically trained<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;on that language pair alone, both in terms of BLEU score and human<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;judgment.},<br>
